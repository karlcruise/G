# Diagnosis and Fix for "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')" Error

## Problem Description
In the JavaScript file `homescript.js`, there is the following assignment:

```js
const menun = document.querySelector('menun')
```

This selector attempts to find an element named `<menun>`, but no such element exists in the DOM. As a result, `menun` is assigned `null`.

Later in the code, there is an operation:

```js
menun.classList.toggle('play');
```

Since `menun` is `null`, attempting to access `classList` causes the error:

```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')
```

## Underlying Cause
The element intended to be selected has the class `menun` and the id `menu1`. The correct CSS selectors for these would be:

- Class selector: `.menun`
- ID selector: `#menu1`

The selector `'menun'` is interpreted as an element selector, which fails because no such element exists.

## Recommended Fix
Change the selector to correctly target the element with class `menun` or id `menu1`.

Possible fixes (choose one as per desired element):

### Option 1: Select by class
```js
const menun = document.querySelector('.menun');
```

### Option 2: Select by id
```js
const menun = document.getElementById('menu1');
```

Then use `menun.classList.toggle('play');` safely.

Ensure this change is applied before any code attempts to access `menun.classList`.

## Summary
By correcting the selector to `.menun` or `#menu1`, the variable `menun` will hold a valid DOM element reference, preventing the null pointer error on accessing `classList`.
