# Documentation: Usage of document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--op', '1')

## Purpose
The line `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--op', '1');` sets the CSS custom property `--op` to the value `'1'` on the root document element (`<html>`). This dynamically updates a CSS variable that controls the opacity and visibility of several UI elements.

## Context of Usage
This command is called in the JavaScript file `homescript.js` within click event listeners on specific elements with classes `animborder1` and `animborder2`.

When these elements are clicked, the JavaScript not only makes the associated menu elements (`#menu1`, `#menu2`) visible by setting their `display` property to `grid`, but also sets the CSS variable `--op` to `'1'`.

## CSS Variable `--op`
The `--op` variable is defined in the CSS root scope with an initial value of `0`:

```css
:root {
  --gap: 300px;
  --dis: 253px;
  --op: 0;
}
```

It is used extensively across multiple style rules to control the opacity of various elements, including but not limited to:

- `.images` elements use `opacity: var(--op);`
- `.animborder` elements use `opacity: calc(var(--op) * 0.6);`

Moreover, it is integrated into several CSS keyframe animations (e.g., `summon`, `summon1`, `summon2`) that use `var(--op)` to transition opacity smoothly from `0` to near full opacity.

## Effect on UI
By setting `--op` to `'1'`, the code triggers these opacity-linked styles and animations, causing the UI elements such as menus and animated border images to fade in and become visible.

This technique allows for centralized and dynamic control of element visibility and transitions via a single CSS variable, which can be toggled through JavaScript to create smooth visual effects based on user interaction.

## Summary
- The line updates a CSS custom property affecting global opacity control in the UI.
- It enables fade-in animations for menus and related elements upon specific user interactions.
- This approach provides maintainable and flexible style manipulation using CSS variables and JavaScript.
